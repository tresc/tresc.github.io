					<p>Loyalty is a major theme throughout "The Kite Runner" Hassan repeatedly shows loyalty to Amir in the story. When Assef tells Hassan that he would let him go if given Amir's kite, Hassan refuses and takes the beating and rape instead of giving in. Another example is when Hassan is confronted by
					Assef and his Taliban Army at Baba's house, and he holds his ground in an attempt to protect his fathers house and possessions. The extremist group then kills both him and his wife for their disobedience.</p> 

					<p>Amir, after living his entire life in fear and guilt, finally realizes that he must show the loyalty that Hassan had been showing him all these years, and instead of hiding and forgetting about Hassan and his family he decides to confront Assef and save Hassan's son, Sohrab, from the same attacks that fell his father. This theme of loyalty continues throughout the book and is shown passing on from Hassan to Amir as the book develops.</p>
