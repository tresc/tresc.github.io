					<p>The Taliban plays a key role in "The Kite Runner" because of the novel being set in Afghanistan. The main antagonist of the novel, Assef, even ended up as a leader of the Taliban Army. The Taliban ruled large portions of Afghanistan beginning in 1996 and coming to an end in 2001, and was even given diplomatic recognition from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The Taliban surfaced after the Soviet Afghan War and was a major influence throughout the novel to the life of Amir and Hassan. This is mainly a result of Assef and his Taliban soldiers as they continuously attack and trouble Amir and those close to him.</p>

					<p>As Amir grew throughout the story he was constantly manipulated by the Taliban and more specifically Assef. Even before Assef joined the Taliban he directly attacked Amir by raping Hassan. Later on when Assef and his Taliban soldiers raid Baba's old house and kill Hassan and his wife, Amir is inspired to do good and eventually finds Assef's Taliban group who is holding Hassan's son Sohrab hostage. This time instead of watching and standing by Amir acts and protects Sohrab from the same attack that his father had received those many years ago. Because of the emergence of the Taliban throughout the story Amir's life is changed forever. However he does not let the strife and struggle ruin him, instead he is able to turn from the misery of Hassan's rape and death, learn from it, and eventually save Sohrab in the long run.</p>
